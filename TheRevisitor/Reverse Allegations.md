## Reverse Allegations
Let's begin with the fact that he **acknowledged** the claims were fake and admitted he was only making them to **slander Eon’s name and brand**. In the end, he got clowned for it.

## False Claims Debunked
A **very talented reverse engineer** debunked this claim and confirmed that the site shown was **not** the official Eon site. This was further proven by the screenshot below the real Eon site was publicly announced in our server.

There are also similar fake replicas created for other projects like **Retrac** and **Era**, yet **only Eon was targeted** in this way. This shows clear intent to slander and blame.

## Clear Admission of Slander
He even admits he doesn’t **actually know** if it’s Eon-related further proving this was just an attempt to harm the Solaris brand. The intent was never about safety, only to cause problems.

We also posted the official **Triage** results (similar to VirusTotal) to scan Eon’s files, which were proven to be **100% safe**.
