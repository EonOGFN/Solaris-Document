### TheRevisitor caught cheating
As a side note, TheRevisitor claims that "Eon is unsafe." This claim is false. He has been part of the Eon community for about a year and has played on multiple accounts, even sharing videos of himself playing. It makes no sense to call it a virus when he actively uses it. His statement appears to be an attempt to slander the brand.

### The text he posted was sarcastic, followed by an actual screenshot of him cheating in Eon. It’s clear that his intent is to constantly ruin the player experience, while the team keeps posting patches just to bypass them and damage Eon as much as possible.
