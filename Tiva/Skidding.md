## Owner of Era, Danii, Admitting Solaris is Skidded

This speaks for itself. Danii, the **owner of Era**, one of the **biggest OG Fortnite servers** and possibly the number one project in the scene, said it clearly:

It closely resembles the Riot Games Launcher, just with an OGFN twist. There’s practically no difference apart from the color scheme.

It’s self-explanatory that this is LawinServerV2, and it’s not hard to tell that it isn’t something else.
