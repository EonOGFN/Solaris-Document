## Tiva Snitching on His Own Staff

Tiva attempted to **ruin his own staff’s reputation** by leaking this, likely thinking it would cause even more damage. What’s obvious here is that **Rio had no clue** why he was even sent this, the two aren’t friends, nor are they in contact.

It seems they just find it “funny” to **snitch on each other**, laugh about **cyber crimes**, and casually throw it all into the so-called *Solaris Document* like it’s a joke.
