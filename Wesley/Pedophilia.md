## Sending CP to Another Solaris Staff Member

Wesley admitted in a reply to Revbistor that he **sent CP to Egator**
For those who don’t know what **“CP”** refers to, please **look it up only for definition purposes** and **only if you're over the age of 18**. It is **traumatizing**, **highly illegal**, and not something to take lightly in any context
